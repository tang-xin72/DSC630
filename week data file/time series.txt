AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models are among the most widely used time series forecasting techniques: In an Autoregressive model, the forecasts correspond to a linear combination of past values of the variable.

pd.to_datetime(df[["year", "month", "day"]])

Step1:
predict using arima

Step2. if build Arima, not AR, then using article below to select arima parameters.
